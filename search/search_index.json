I've completed several IT-related internships in the past, and am hoping to gain more practical software engineering experience in this course. Apart from my major-related interests, I also co-founded Alabama Crimson Cubing and help organize in-person Rubik's Cube competitions and online inter-collegiate tournaments. Bradley Hicks (email: bjhicks@crimson.ua.edu) I am a Senior Computer Science Student at UA that is also pursuing and MBA at UA. I have interest AI applications and full stack development, and I have worked for close to a year as a software development intern at Penta Research in Huntsville, Alabama. I have experience in React, Python, and AI related libraries like the OpenAI Agent SDK, and am open to learning new languages and platforms. I am a member of the Million Dollar Band at UA, as well as the Mario Kart team and the Calvary Baptist Church Orchestra. I hope to gain experience working with front-end heavy development and database management, and I hope to learn to better interact and collaborate with outside sponsors and companies. Thomas Gray (email: tcgray2@crimson.ua.edu) I\u2019m currently a Senior CS student in the AMP program at the University of Alabama. My concentration is in cybersecurity, but I also have a passion for software design. I\u2019m really interested in finding ways to combine those two interests in my future career. Through my internships and classes at UA, I\u2019ve worked with everything from C/C++ and SQL to functional languages like Clojure and Lisp. I also have experience with LeanIX and Enterprise Architecture. This project has allowed me to get familiar with React and Supabase, which I\u2019m excited to keep using moving forward. Aside from CS, I enjoy playing and watching sports. I played basketball and baseball for years, and I'm a fan of the Memphis Grizzlies and the Baltimore Ravens. Will Morrow (email: wcmorrow2@crimson.ua.edu) I am a senior at the University of Alabama majoring in Computer Science. I am interested in automation, and I have experience developing internal tools for clients with high security standards. This semester I am hoping to gain experience in web development working in a larger team. I attend First Baptist of Tuscaloosa, and in my spare time, I enjoy watching football, cooking, and physical media art.","title":"Team Bios"},{"location":"bio/#team-bios","text":"","title":"Team Bios"},{"location":"bio/#john-shidemantle-email-jcshidemantlecrimsonuaedu","text":"I am a Senior Computer Science AMP student at UA and am particularly interested in full-stack web development.
