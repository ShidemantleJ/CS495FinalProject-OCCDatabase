# Team Bios

## John Shidemantle (email: jcshidemantle@crimson.ua.edu)

I am a Senior Computer Science AMP student at UA and am particularly interested in full-stack web development. I've completed several IT-related internships in the past, and am hoping to gain more practical software engineering experience in this course. Apart from my major-related interests, I also co-founded Alabama Crimson Cubing and help organize in-person Rubik's Cube competitions and online inter-collegiate tournaments.

## Bradley Hicks (email: bjhicks@crimson.ua.edu)

I am a Senior Computer Science Student at UA that is also pursuing and MBA at UA. I have interest AI applications and full stack development, and I have worked for close to a year as a software development intern at Penta Research in Huntsville, Alabama. I have experience in React, Python, and AI related libraries like the OpenAI Agent SDK, and am open to learning new languages and platforms. I am a member of the Million Dollar Band at UA, as well as the Mario Kart team and the Calvary Baptist Church Orchestra. I hope to gain experience working with front-end heavy development and database management, and I hope to learn to better interact and collaborate with outside sponsors and companies.
