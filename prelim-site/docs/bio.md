## John Shidemantle (email: jcshidemantle@crimson.ua.edu)

I am a Senior Computer Science AMP student at UA and am particularly interested in full-stack web development. I've completed several IT-related internships in the past, and am hoping to gain more practical software engineering experience in this course. Apart from my major-related interests, I also co-founded Alabama Crimson Cubing and help organize in-person Rubik's Cube competitions and online inter-collegiate tournaments.
